    "You will estimate demand and supply in a stylized model of the market for pay-TV services. You will use any programming language (Python/R/Matlab/Julia) to create your own fake data set for the industry and do some relatively simple estimation. Then, using the `pyBLP` package of Conlon and Gortmaker, you will estimate the model and perform some merger simulations. Using data you generate yourself gives you a way to check whether the estimation is working; this is a good thing to try whenever you code up an estimator! The pyBLP package has excellent documentation and a very helpful tutorial (which covers merger simulation), both easy to find at https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. You may want to work through the tutorial notebooks available with the documentation (or on the Github page)."
